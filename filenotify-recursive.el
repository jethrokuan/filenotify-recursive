;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  This is an extension of the built-in filenotify library, making it apply

The returned value is a UUID. If the file cannot be watched for
some reason, this function signals a `file-notify-error' error.

FLAGS is a list of conditions to set what will be watched for. It
can include the following symbols:

  `change'           -- watch for file changes
  `attribute-change' -- watch for file attributes changes, like
                        permissions or modification time


When any event happens, Emacs will call the CALLBACK function passing
it a single argument EVENT, which is of the form

  (DESCRIPTOR ACTION FILE [FILE1])

DESCRIPTOR is the same object as the one returned by this function.
ACTION is the description of the event.  It could be any one of the
following:

  `created'           -- FILE was created
  `deleted'           -- FILE was deleted
  `changed'           -- FILE has changed
  `renamed'           -- FILE has been renamed to FILE1
  `attribute-changed' -- a FILE attribute was changed
  `stopped'           -- watching FILE has been stopped

FILE is the name of the file whose event is being reported.

If REGEXP is non-nil, do not watch directories matching REGEXP."
